# Case-Study 
## How Morgan Stanley is adjusting to FinTech
---
Morgan Stanley was founded in 1935 in Mew York, New York and has been a staple of Wall Street and Big Banks ever since. 

The giant we know it to be today got its name from its founders Henry Sturgis Morgan & Harold Stanley

The birth of Morgan Stanley was a result of the Glass-Steagall Act that required US banks to keep their investment banking and commercial banking entities seperate.

Morgan Stannley targets clients that includes foundations, endowment funds, and individual investors to give them capital to invest.

## Business Activities

Morgan Stanley's goal, per their mission statement, is "Work with colleagues to deliver the best of the Firm to every client; Listen to what the client is saying and needs". Which can be intrepreted as delivering ethical value (rate of return) to their clients.

As mentioned above, Morgan Stanley primarily targets "Whales" or large institutional investors. This is demonstrated by the astonishing ~$904 Billion in AUM.

They believe to hold a competitive advantage by employing some of the brightest financial minds along with adapting and implementing the latest and greatest technology available.

Currently, they use applications such as Python, PHP, Amazon EC2, and slick to name a few. Alongside utilities such as Google Analytics and OpenSSL.

## Results

If I were highered as a consultant, I would strongley reccomend the continued use of FinTech adoption for a few ley areas such as Investment Decisions and ease of access for their clients accross their web applications.

I think the consumer is more interested in ease of access and transparency when it comes to their money. With more and more retail investors coming into the scene, people want to see how their money is invested & if they continue to pay their advisory fees they will expect a superior rate of return.

Technologies would include easy client portals both online and phone applications for the consumer. For the institution, it would be better forecasting models used in various programs.
